# Million Songs Dataset mining

This is a Data Mining course project.

We have tried to apply certain data-mining algorithms on the [MSD](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) and the results of our work can be found in this repository. We have used additional tools such as [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/) and [IBM SPSS Modeler](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-modeler) to visualize the results. 

The paper (in Serbian) can be read [here](ShippingVersion.pdf).
